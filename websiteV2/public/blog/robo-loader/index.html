  <p>This post is about a game I made with javascript canvas. In the game you play as a robot who&#39;s job it is to put stuff on conveyor belts for puny humans to work on. The whole thing was an effort to understand some of the basics of design and balancing for games.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>A common thing seen in video games is that parts of their mechanics can be seen as modular and a game in and of themselves.
A real life example of this might be that you are walking down the street while trying to go somewhere (the game as a whole), and
you have to watch your feet and avoid stepping on cracks(mini-game).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HoffsMH/robo-loader">Github</a><br>
<a href="/robo-loader">Demo</a></p>

<h4>So I really like World of Warcraft.</h4>

<p>And WoW has such a mini-game.
Game balancing also really interest me too
so I tried to distill the basic mechanics of this of this mini-game into a javascript canvas game. so I could turn some knobs and see how they affect the way it plays.</p>

<h5>The things I was interested in were:</h5>

<ul>
<li>pacing</li>
<li>difficulty</li>
<li>depth</li>
</ul>

<p>The game can be played <a href="/robo-loader">here</a>. Please note the game might look different now than at the time of this post but the basic mechanics will still be in place.</p>

<h3>Basics:</h3>

<p>You are a robot that works in a factory that has a number of horizontal Lanes( 4 in this picture). Inside of each is a &quot;conveyor belt&quot; with a number of cells. The cells move to the right and carry whatever is placed on them.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robo-loader/basic-game.gif" alt="basic game"></p>

<p>On the left side of the screen is a &quot;Loading Area&quot; where we can put a certain amount of &quot;material&quot; down on a given Conveyor Belt.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robo-loader/red-3-game.gif" alt="red 3"></p>

<p>Here we just put down 3 red blobs worth of material. The numbers on the left mean that the next time we put down a red material on that lane we will only put down 2 blobs worth of red material.</p>

<p>Lets look at the next game mechanic...</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robo-loader/workers-intro-game.gif" alt="workers intro"></p>

<p>The white boxes represent the workers in this factory. The workers will move to the left while they have nothing to work on. If a single worker reaches the loading area the game is over.</p>

<p>By putting down material on a conveyor belt for a lane worker to work on you impede its progress towards the loading area.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robo-loader/blob-intro.gif" alt="blob intro"></p>

<p>You might have noticed that there are 2 sets of numbers on the left. The big number, as I mentioned before, represents how many blobs of material you would place on the given conveyor belt if you were to press enter. The second smaller set of numbers is a counter that counts down till you can place the maximum amount of blobs again.</p>

<h4>We are now approaching the center of what this game is really about...</h4>

<p>The game is really about managing diminishing returns! Something that has a diminishing return means I get a decreased effect from doing the same thing repeatedly. In order to keep the workers from getting to the left side of the screen I need to think about what lanes and color combinations are available to me at a given time.</p>

<p>For instance I might be out of yellow blobs on lane 1 but I have plenty red blobs left on that lane, and I might be out of red blobs on lane 2 but I have plenty of yellow blobs left on that lane. A few seconds later that situation may reverse and I have to keep track of that.</p>

<h4>One more thing:</h4>

<p>Each color can only exist once per &quot;column&quot;. This prevents me from just spamming colors across the lanes at all times.</p>

<p>Lets say that all conveyor belts have 12 cells on which we can place blobs. If I put a Yellow blob on cell 1 of lane 2 that means that all other lanes&#39;s cell 1 are cleared of yellow blobs. If I put a yellow blob on lane 1 and immediately afterwards put a yellow blob on lane 2 the yellow blob on lane 1 will disappear.</p>

<h4>At a glance:</h4>

<p>When taken together the game is about juggling different colors on different lanes in order to keep the workers from reaching the end.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robo-loader/average-game.gif" alt="average game"></p>

<h4>Tweaking it:</h4>

<p>I tried to write this in such a way that changing certain aspects of the game would be easy. I did this by creating engines that would update and render the game  generically, regardless of their structure or settings. I then created a default settings file in <code>lib/game-settings/board-settings</code> that contained everything about the game that could be changed. All of the properties for each of the games components were set by the contents of this file so that if I wanted to change something like</p>

<ul>
<li>amount of lanes</li>
<li>amount of cells to a lane</li>
<li>how long before diminsing returns reset</li>
<li>how fast workers moved up the lane</li>
<li>how long it took for a worker to clear a single blob</li>
<li>the rate at which workers speed up making the game gradually harder</li>
</ul>

<p>I could easily do so and see how it affected the way the game plays</p>

<h4>Lessons:</h4>

<p>It was surprisingly easy to balance, I did not see that coming! It took me 5 minutes
of fiddling with the numbers and I had a playable. The hard part was to
make a fun game, or at the very least a game where the player had to focus on the mechanics that I
wanted him or her to focus on.</p>

<p>If the time it takes for diminishing returns to reset on a given color/lane is too low
its easy to spam buttons until you get something set down for a lane.</p>

<p>If the workers proceed up the lanes too slow the player can plan too far ahead which
colors he or she might put down, too fast and theres no time to think about what diminishing returns are available.</p>

<p>If it takes a worker too long to consume a single blob the fact that blobs diminish becomes less powerful since it only takes one blob to set a worker back alot.</p>

<p>Another thing I plan to eventually implement is some degree of randomness that might occasionally clear an entire lane of blobs but leave the diminishing returns for that lane intact.</p>

<p>If it sounds like changing stuff in the game and seeing for yourself might interest you I suggest
<a href="https://github.com/HoffsMH/robo-loader">pulling it down</a> and trying for yourself!</p>

          <p>Up until relatively recently I had not been embracing the &quot;programmers notebook&quot;. But it has a hold on me now.
I plan to go over what changed and how I got into the note-taking groove.
I also plan to go into why, in my opinion, pen and paper actually trumps all the other tools and mediums for note taking, even when, and perhaps especially when
the subject is software design.</p>
